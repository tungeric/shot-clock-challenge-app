# Shot Clock Challenge JS

[Live page](http)

## Background and Overview
Arcades all over the world feature the "Super Shot" basketball game where you try to make as many buckets as you can in 24 seconds. The Shot Clock Challenge JS recreates this game in 2D. Users will click, drag and release points on the screen to shoot the ball towards the basket (or at anywhere just to watch the basketballs bounce around). Featuring a left-handed Steph Curry, take aim at a basket and a self-created physics engine and beat your high score!

## Key features
* Self-created physics engine, complete with elastic collisions between basketball and rim, basketball and backboard, and basketball with the ground. The physics engine also supports drag and can be modified to simulate different viscous materials such as water or molasses - though this feature is not yet highlighted in-game.
